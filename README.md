# Have your resume in the cloud and the cloud in your resume

While I was a student, it was a great challenge to get a part time job in the field of cloud development, but I figured how to overcome it! I made a very basic CV which is hosted on Microsoft Azure, which shows a basic skillset of the usage of App Services, source control (GitHub) and HTML. So I had my resume in the cloud, and by that I had the cloud in my resume!
